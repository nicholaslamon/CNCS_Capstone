# CNCS Capstone
Welcome to our Github Repo that will document the growth and development of our Capstone Project. This project will be a dynamic, living thing that will likely change dozens of times over the course of our fall semester. During the spring semester, we shall excuted and develop our tested project.

## Current Project Ideas
* Home Security

### Overview
  This topic is relevant and important in the world of cybersecurity becuase physical secuirty is the lowest level of secuirty. No matter how secure you might have something from an IT prespective, none of that will matter if the physical door to the server room is left open. This topic intrests us because it was not covered all that much during our time at Champlain and some of the most cutting-edge tech is within the physical secuirty world.
  
### Description
  For this topic we would implement physical security measures (door access, cameras, etc) where resources allow into a lab type enviornment. We would build a seperate network issolated from a main network but still accessible, both onsite and remotely. This topic would be rigorous enough due to the multitude of different technologies that would need to be implemneted for all of this to work.
  
* Incident Reponse Plan
